                                You can reschedule your reservation for free if it's more than 24 hours before your pickup time. 
                                However, a 20% charge applies in the following cases:
                                <ol class="list-style-lower-alpha">
                                    <li>

                                        Rescheduling due to flight delays or early arrivals. If the flight is delayed multiple times, 
                                        each delay incurs a 20% charge. Rescheduling is not allowed within 2 hours of your pickup time. 
                                        In such cases, you need to cancel without a refund and make a new booking. 
                                        You can reschedule through your confirmation booking email.
